              "' JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. Supplier Travel and Expense Policy states that JPMC will reimburse up to $65 per day for meals, including tax and tip (Breakfast - $10, Lunch - $15 and Dinner - $40). JPMC does not reimburse for lunch unless you typically bring your lunch each day to work or there is no JPMC cafeteria available. In the U.S., tipping up to 15% is warranted for good service and only exceptional service warrants a 20% tip. For non-U.S. locations, tipping should be calculated in accordance with reasonable and customary practices in the applicable location. If a hotel is utilized that offers free breakfast, additional breakfast expenses will not be reimbursed. Reimbursement for overnight lodging will be provided only if the overnight lodging is a JPMC business-related requirement and specifically pre-approved by the JPMC Manager. Supplier Personnel are to use standard single hotel accommodations at the prevailing commercial rates within a reasonable distance from the destination location. The use of high-priced rooms, suites, executive floors or concierge levels is not reimbursable. Hotels over $300/night require the pre-approval by the JPMC Manager.
